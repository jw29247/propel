# Propel Vision

Propel exists to give professional services businesses the operational leverage of a large enterprise — through AI agent teams that run 24/7.

## The Problem

Professional services firms (law, accounting, consulting) rely on skilled people for repetitive operational tasks: intake, scheduling, research, compliance checks, client communication. This work is essential but doesn't scale — hiring more people is expensive, slow, and introduces inconsistency.

## The Solution

Propel is an AI operations platform that deploys autonomous agent teams into your business. These agents handle the operational work that keeps your firm running:

- **Client intake and triage** — Qualify leads, gather information, route to the right team
- **Research and analysis** — Pull data, summarise documents, prepare briefings
- **Compliance monitoring** — Track deadlines, flag risks, ensure regulatory adherence
- **Communication management** — Draft responses, manage follow-ups, maintain client relationships

## Principles

- **Enterprise-grade security** — Every client deployment is fully isolated. No shared data, no cross-tenant risk.
- **Model-agnostic** — Works with Anthropic, OpenAI, and other providers. No vendor lock-in.
- **Channel-native** — Agents operate where your team already works: email, messaging, internal tools.
- **Measurable impact** — Clear metrics on time saved, tasks completed, and operational efficiency.

## Direction

We are building the platform that makes AI agents practical for real businesses — not demos, not toys, but production systems that professional services firms trust with their operations.

The focus: reliability, security, and measurable ROI.
